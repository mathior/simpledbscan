Usage: dbscan2d POINTSFILE [EPSILON CORE_MIN_NEIGHBORS]

Reads POINTSFILE, clusters the points with DBScan and writes the clustering to
stdout. POINTSFILE must be a text file where each line denotes one point in the
format
x y [...]
and x and y must be interpretable as integers. Only the first two
space-separated integers are considered as input, further characters are
discarded.
The output is in the format
x y label
where "label" is an integer. A label value of -1 denotes a noise point and all
values >0 denote the cluster assignment of the point (x, y).
(Note that a label of 0 denotes an unassigned point and should not appear in the
final clustering.)
OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
  EPSILON  The maximum distance where points count as neighbors.
           Default is 4.
  CORE_MIN_NEIGHBORS  The minimum required points in the epsilon distance
                      to count a point as core point. Default is 2.
